## I'm Eunchan Lee

Hello world! 

I'm an ordinary NLPer in 🇰🇷.  I'm thinking about making creative and useful self-made open-source projects based on LLM, NLP.

I studied at [Kyungpook National University, School of Electronic Engineering](https://see.knu.ac.kr/), earned bachelor's and master's degrees. 

During my undergraduate years, I led many SW term projects by participating in practical major classes and external activities. [[portfolio in Korean]](https://github.com/purang2/SW2020eval), minored in Software programming. 

I worked as a researcher at ***[KNU Brain-AI Lab](https://knu-brainai.github.io/)***.(2020-09-01 - 2023-02-17)

Also I participated as a member of ***[the 4th SKT AI Fellowship](https://www.sktuniv.com/)*** course! (Our topic was Multi-modal AI R&D such as DALL:E2, FLAMINGO). (2022-05 - 2022-11)

Currently I worked as a research intern at ***[UNIST Language & Intelligence Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/language-intelligence-lab/home?authuser=0)*** (2023-01-30 - 2023-05-30).

And I'm considering choosing between going to a Ph.D. program or getting an industry job seriously.
